Create a Hangman game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The game should give feedback after each guess and keep track of remaining attempts.

#### Requirements

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the player
- Show the current progress (e.g. _ _ _ _ for a 4-letter word)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display a friendly win or lose message

#### Example

Word: _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: a
Word: _ a _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 5
...etc...
```
